            "review":"AfterShoot is becoming such a fundamental part of my image creating process that I’m learning to trust its algorithm just as previous generations of photographers learned to “trust the camera” in regards to metering. The result of relinquishing front end control of image selection to an always improving resource outside of my own mind, is freed up mental headspace. I can immediately begin with complex edits on the prime images, or turn entire collections around for delivery in a fraction of the time!"
